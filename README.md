# Welcome to RndBank!

**What is RndBank?**
- RndBank is an esocentric bank that I created! Its gimmick is that everytime you log in you have a randomly allocated bank balance anywhere from 0 to 1,000,000 should you be so lucky :)

**The Project**
- As funny and quirky as the concept of RndBank is, it is not the point of this project, the goal of this project was too make somthing mirroring a real world scenario
- I decided to create a login and authentication system using python

**Features**
- Interface using tkinter
- modular programming
- a plain text holding user info
- encrypted passwords using my own ceaser cypher
- sign up and login functions
- error handling such as not allowing empty fields

**Interface**
- It was my first proper time using tkinter as I had previously messed around with it, I found it hard at the start to use the grid configuration to get all the widgets in the right places. Besides this I enjoyed learning tkinter and will definitely encorparate it again!

**Password Encryption**
- Instead of importing an encryption module I used the one I had made previously using python dictonaries, however I did beef it up to include 93 characters instead of the original 26
